Week of 9/7-9/14
I have used AI for some help in parts of assigned tasks, like using it to help connect RStudio to GitHub. 
I also tried to prompt it to generate an image in Adobe InDesign, although I wasn't satisfied with any of the option so I decided to make something myself.
Another notable use of AI this week was getting a recipe (that I double checked with reddit) to make a savory pretzel dinner.

Week of 9/15-9/21
I used AI to help me create a few resumes for simple job applications around College Park. I also used it to help me trim my 
notes down for my government class. I tried to use it to help me memorize East Asia, but it wasn't really any help. I also used
it to help me with some of the INST326 exercises that I got stuck on. Specifically on the 26th and 30th questions in the 
exercises, I was having some trouble with my loops, so I used Claude to debug and recommend alternative solutions.


Week of 9/22-/28
I used AI to help debug the nested loops for exercises 12 and 19, as I was struggling to get them to a readable or concise
state. I also tried to use it to create a mnemonic for memorizing countries and their capitals in Southeast Asia. The 
recommendations for that were pretty useless, but it was still a nice way to consume and memorize information in a new
way, as opposed to the online map quiz I took 20 times in the weeks leading up to my quiz.

Week of 9/28-10/5
I used AI to help me learn about the search strategies and ways to use key words, which was important for one of my other classes. I also used it to help me study for my first International Relations Midterm, by summarizing notes and clarifying some key definitions that I was consistently getting wrong on Quizlet.
