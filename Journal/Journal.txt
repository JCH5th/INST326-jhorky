Week of 9/7-9/14
I have used AI for some help in parts of assigned tasks, like using it to help connect RStudio to GitHub. 
I also tried to prompt it to generate an image in Adobe InDesign, although I wasn't satisfied with any of the option so I decided to make something myself.
Another notable use of AI this week was getting a recipe (that I double checked with reddit) to make a savory pretzel dinner.

Week of 9/15-9/21
I used AI to help me create a few resumes for simple job applications around College Park. I also used it to help me trim my 
notes down for my government class. I tried to use it to help me memorize East Asia, but it wasn't really any help. I also used
it to help me with some of the INST326 exercises that I got stuck on. Specifically on the 26th and 30 questions in the 
exercises, I was having some trouble with my loops, so I used Claude to debug and recommend alternative solutions.
